# cv-facial-detection
This repository included some files, a file about Facial Detection, another is related to Webcam Recalling, a python file is related to labling the image. 
To Facial Detection, I install Numpy and Opencv-Python by pip. Then, I searched and found some codes on it. I tried them, some works and others doesn't work.
